The coding challenge consists of three functions that check if a given input string is a palindrome, reverse the string, and display the reversed string along with a message to the user. The getValue function gets the user input string, passes it to the palindrome function to check if it is a palindrome and get its reversed version, and then passes the return object to the displayString function to show the message and reversed string to the user. The palindrome function converts the string to lowercase, removes special characters and spaces, reverses the string using a for loop, and compares the reversed version with the original string to determine if it is a palindrome. The displayString function sets the message and reversed string on the HTML page and makes them visible to the user.
